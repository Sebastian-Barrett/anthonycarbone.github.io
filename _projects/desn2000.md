The project I chose for the second-year Engineering course DESN2000 - Engineering Design and Professional Practice - was to design a subtitute for the current lashing system used for shipping containers.

It goes without saying, but the advent of [containerisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization) brought remarkable benefits to countries around the world, and now transport 90% of goods worldwide.

These containers are often secured to ships by several devices, including [twistlocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twistlock) and [lashing rods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship#Lashing_systems) (pictured below).

Despite these efforts, containers are lost at sea or damaged due to heavy seas and/or improper securing or maintenance of the lashing rods. Furthermore, the current lashing process is labour and time intensive, and incurs significant docking costs to the shipping operators.

With that said, the project goal was to design a substitute lashing system costing under $100 that would prevent container loss or damage, and decrease application time.

The role I took in the team of seven was that of a team lead, and was responsible for the mechanical design.

The team and I brainstormed some ideas with sketches and settled on a sort of rotary locking core that would adapt to the loads applied, simplify and speed up application, and be flexible enough to incorporate sophisticated lashing arrangements.

Having little CAD and design experience, I took to Fusion360 with a few sketches came up with this:

As one could tell, I took inspiration from the ratchet mechanism, and ultimately created a near symmetrical design, to reduce unique parts for manufacturability and ease of maintenence.

It is by no means a flawless design and could benefit from harsh critiquing, but I think sheds some light on a novel idea for a crucial purpose.

#### What I Learned
- CAD modelling is frustrating to the point of exhaustion, at times
- Sketches are just as important to the design process as CAD models
- It's crucial in leading a team to communicate explicitly deliverables and expectations
