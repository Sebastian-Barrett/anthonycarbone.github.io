Above *should* be up to date with [my resume GitHub repo](https://github.com/anthonycarbone/resume). The repository's README reads:

> This resume uses the beatiful [Awesome CV template](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). It also includes some features from [Derwent McElhinney's take on the template](https://github.com/derwentx/Resumee), specifically the icons and icon sections, as well as the references section from an [Awesome CV issue](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV/issues/94).
